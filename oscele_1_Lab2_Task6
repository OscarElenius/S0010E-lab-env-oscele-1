Note: Task 5 and 4 is included in the Task 3 project.

Reflection:

  - I learned to use input to change my character behaviour using c++. I already knew how to create a project and make different maps.
  - The most difficult thing in this lab was setting up my project so I could do Task 5. I overcame this by asking fellow students to get a more clear understanding.
  - The lab can be improved by changing the instructions on Task 5, either so you remove the text from the book or that you include more text from the book. 
  Having little of both doesnt help unless we get all the information nessesary.
  
  Time to complete lab: ~3-4 hours.
