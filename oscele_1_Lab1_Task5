Reflection:

  - I learned to navigate and know the layout of Unreal Engine 4. I already knew the basic concept of Unreal.
  - The most difficult thing in this lab was the lab instructions prior to Task 4. To overcome this I asked my classmates and together we came to a consensus on how 
  the lab will be preformed.
  - The lab can be restructured like so: 
                                        Task 1: Download nessessary programs.
                                        Task 2: Merge Task 3 & 4 into here (Task 3 feels very unnecessary).
                                        Task 3: Additional content to get a better understanding of Unreal Engine.
                                        Task 4: Reflection (no video).
  
  Time to complete lab: ~2 Hours (about 80% is just setting up programs)
